## Welcome to Our Website!

Thank you for your interest in our project. At this time, it is in the early stages of development. 

If you would like to learn more about our project, please visit our [About](https://henryrodgers.github.io/about.html) page.

Our program currently has the following features, which may be visited and tested at their respective pages:

[Mapping](https://henryrodgers.github.io/map.html) - This feature uses the Mapquest API to import a map into our program. This API has the potential to be used for visualizing data geographically in the future, but it is currently just displaying a test map centered on our school building. Feel free to test the map by moving around and visiting places that are familiar to you!

[Table](https://henryrodgers.github.io/table.html) - This table tests two features that have potential for our Data Visualization program. The first is a basic table, largely just a product of html, that will be valuable in displaying basic data in the future. However, within this table is the metadata for a CDC COVID-19 data API. This contains much of the vital information we will use to process and understand the raw data this API provides.

Thank you for visiting our site!
